Write a blog post about a learn to learn technique (this blog post does not need to be published)

I have a particular love for the ideals brought on by a culture of error.  I usually feel comfortable being wrong for the sake of curiosity or just out of good ol fashioned ignorance. I recently found a pdf book http://www.wiley.com/legacy/downloads/CultureofError_Ebook.pdf for teachers that brought me some great insight on culture of error it also lays out 4 key parts of culture of error...

1. Expect Error
  * Out with the old assumption that getting it right the first time is the only way.
2. Withhold the Answer
  * I thought that this was interesting.  As I am currently acting in the capacity of student this does not apply directly to me although I am on the other side of it frequently.  It also lays out this idea that we learn by exploring and that there is value in wrong answers as they give us insight into other ways of thinking about things and those ways of thinking may lead us to greater insight overall.
3. Manage the Tell
  * Again this sounds pretty specific to someone acting in the capacity of teacher.  The insight that I glean from this is making a deliberate effort to be aware of our own judgments of rightness as regards ourselves and others.  I'm learning to avoid quick conclusions about correctness and to value the process of learning as a means of achieving the desired ends more efficiently.
4. Encourage Risk-Taking
  * This is another one that reminds me of the importance of exploring.  I try to push myself in this regard --deleting local repositories in order to build and burn them-- lol.  When we can feel comfortable taking risks openly for the sake of growing we open the floor to anyone who might be able to lend some deeper understanding I think that this is a key to peer supported learning as well.

I have benefited greatly from the culture of error we have here at Galvanize it really creates a safe feeling environment to learn in and that's a nice change of pace.  I also believe that I learn faster this way as well.
