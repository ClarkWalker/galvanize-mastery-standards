Culture of ERROR

A classroom is a culture established through
the words and actions not only of the teacher
but also of the students. A teacher alone
cannot establish a culture in which it is
safe to struggle and fail. If snickers greet
a classmate who gets an answer wrong, for
example, or if impatient hands wave in the
air while another student is trying to answer,
very little that a teacher does will result in
students’ exposing their errors to anyone.

Shaping how students respond to one another’s
struggles is therefore a must, and is
a process that starts with teaching students
the right way to handle common situations
before they happen. Explain how you expect
them to act when someone struggles with the
rationale, practice those expected behaviors
in hypothetical situations, and when a breach
inevitably occurs, reset the culture firmly,
but with understanding. You might say something
like, “Just a minute. I want to be very
clear about the respect we will all show one
another when we are in this classroom. We
will support each other and help one another.
And we will never, ever undertake actions
that tear down another person. Among other
things, we know that person could just as
well be us.”

When you think about making it safe to
struggle, it’s important to consider that this is
not about just eliminating potentially negative
or corrosive behaviors among your students.
Even better would be fostering a culture
where students actively support one another
as they struggle through the learning process.
Collegiate Academies in New Orleans
does a great job of encouraging this culture.
When someone is struggling to answer a
question, peers (or teachers) “send love,”
making a subtle hand gesture that means,
“I’m supporting you.” It’s one of the most
remarkable and powerful things about a
remarkable group of schools.

Lastly, let’s not forget that it’s not just students
whose errors matter. You will of course
make a mistake at some point in class, too.
That much is inevitable. Most likely, your
mistake will be public, with thirty or so
students watching you make it. They will
note whether you dismiss, deny, minimize,
embrace, acknowledge, or even study it. How
you communicate and depict mistakes—both
students’ and your own—in the classroom is
very important.

That all said, a classroom culture that
respects error, normalizes it, and values
learning from it, is one of the characteristics
of a high-performing classroom. Culture of
Error has four key parts: expecting error,
withholding the answer, managing your tell,
and praising risk-taking.

EXPECT ERROR
Take a moment to examine the language
two champion teachers used to communicate
to their students their expectations about
making mistakes. Consider, first, Bob
Zimmerli, who stopped his class after his
observation revealed a consistent error
(failing to combine like terms) among his
students. “I’m so glad you made that
mistake,” Bob said to the class, calling them
together to reteach. “It’s going to help me to
help you.” Message: the mistake is normal,
valuable in a way, and a source of insight.
Bob is not bothered by the mistakes, but
communicates that he expects them and
that when they happen, he wants to know
about them.

Compare that to something more typical,
along the lines of, “Guys, I should not be
seeing people with –2x and +2x in the same
equation. You know by now to combine like
terms.” In that case, students will quickly
learn that if they are making mistakes, they
are likely to be a source of disappointment
to their teacher. As a result, students are
likely to respond by trying to conceal their
errors. That doesn’t mean they combine
like terms any better, just that when they
struggle, the teacher won’t find out about it.

By the way, I’m not saying here that you
shouldn’t have exacting standards and
expect diligence from your students. You
should. You don’t have to jump up and down
and say, “This mistake is so valuable” every
time you get one. What you are looking to do
is build a culture that, by seizing opportunities
here and there over time, shows that errors
are a normal part of learning and perform
their role best when they are out in the
open. After a mistake occurs, our message
should communicate that we are glad to
know about it and, perhaps, that our first
assumption is that the misunderstanding
is likely to have some cause that is no
anybody’s “fault.” It’s easy to assume that
confused students weren’t paying attention
or don’t value the knowledge, and of course
there are cases when that’s true. However,
it’s far more productive to assume that students
are confused because the material is
complex the first time they see it, or because
our explanations were somehow imperfect
after all, or just because students are like
you and me and sometimes need to go over
it one more time.

Next, consider Roxbury Prep math teacher
Jason Armstrong, who, in one recent lesson,
began communicating his expectations even

 Example Phrases
• “I’m really glad that you made that mistake. It’s going
to help me to help you.”
• “Wrong answers are really helpful because we learn from
the mistakes we make.”
• “Which of these options do you think is my favorite
wrong answer?”
• (After students point out a teacher’s mistake) “Ooh, you
all just caught the best mistake I ever made! This is great!
• “I suspect there’s going to be some disagreement here.”
• After scanning the room to check which answers students
picked, say excitedly, “We have a lot of disagreement on
this one!”

before he started teaching the problem he
was reviewing with his class. Asking to hear
the answers his students came up with, he
didn’t ask for someone who had the “right
answer.” His words were, “Let’s hear people’s
answers for number 2. I suspect there’s
going to be some disagreement here, so
I might hear a couple different people’s
answers.” He then took four different answers
from the class. Each time he asked for more,
his words—“Are there any other answers
out there?”—implied that the normal state
of affairs is to see different answers among
smart people doing challenging work. This
also serves to teach that math is not just a
matter of deciding between a right answer
and a single alternative but, sometimes,
a matter of deciding which among a wide
array of plausible answers makes sense.
If the questions are hard, Jason’s teaching
intimated, of course people will disagree.

WITHHOLD THE ANSWER
In the same lesson as the one I just
described, Jason Armstrong introduced
a second problem to his students for
discussion, and his choice of language
was again striking:
Jason: Okay, now for the four answers we
have here, A, B, C and D, I don’t want to
start by asking which one you think is right,
because I want to focus on the explanations
that we have. So let me hear what people
think of D. I don’t care if you think it’s right or
wrong; I just want to hear what people think.
Eddie, what did you say about it?
You’ve probably noticed that Jason’s language
emphasizes the importance of mathematical
thinking (as opposed to just getting it right).
That’s valuable. Where many teachers say
things like, “I want to focus on the explanation.
How you think about this is as
important as whether you got it right,” what
Jason does is different because students
don’t know whether or not they are discussing
a right answer. He has asked them not to
discuss how they got the answer they gave—
and therefore think is right—but an answer
that he chose.
We often begin reviewing a problem by revealing
the right answer and then, suspense
alleviated, talking about it. However, as
soon as students know the right answer, the
nature of their engagement tends to change.
They shift to thinking about whether they
got it right and how well they did. No matter
how much they love the math for the math’s
sake (or the history or science or literature
for its sake), part of them is thinking “Yes! I
got it” or “Darn, I knew that” or “Darn, why
do I keep messing up?” If Jason had said,
“The answer here is B, but I want to look at
D,” some students would almost assuredly
 Example Phrases
• “For the four options to this question, I don’t want to begin
by asking which one you think is right because I want to
focus on the explanations that we have.”
• “I see several students picked answer choice X and that
several others picked answer choice Y. How can I defend
my answer whether I picked X or Y?”
• “I heard some snaps and I heard some stomps.
College discussion. Be ready to defend your answer.”

have thought, “Cool, I knew that,” and then
stopped listening as closely because in their
minds they had gotten it right and didn’t
need to listen.
One of the simplest and easiest things you
can do to begin building a Culture of Error
is to delay revealing whether an answer is
right or wrong until after you’ve discussed
it, and perhaps an alternative. By withholding
the answer until after you’ve discussed the
question, you retain a bit of suspense, keep
students productively engaged, and avoid
the distraction of “Did I get it right?” for a
few seconds. This can be very productive,
not just as an intellectual exercise, but as a
cultural one, in causing students to spend
less energy evaluating their work (“I got it
right. That’s awesome! I’m awesome” or
“I got it wrong. I am such an idiot”) and
more energy thinking about the underlying
ideas (“I hadn’t thought of doing it that way.
I wonder if he’ll get the answer I got”).
The fact that Jason’s question is a multiplechoice
question makes it simple to withhold
the answer, but it’s also viable to do this
with an open-ended question. If you were
a history teacher and your question was,
“How did the Treaty of Versailles affect
Europe in the twenty years after the treaty?”
you might put up on the board: Here are
some bullet points you might see in an
answer; what do you think? This would be
more productive, probably, than tipping
your hand and saying, “Here are the key
points you should have” or “Here’s Slow
Sally’s answer. What’d she leave out?”
Knowing whether they are looking at right
or wrong answers focuses students more on
evaluating and less on analyzing.

MANAGE THE TELL
In poker circles, players have to watch their
“tell”—the unintentional signals they give
that reveal the status of their hand to savvy
opponents. A good player can figure out that
an opponent’s habit of rubbing his eyes is
a nervous tic revealing a poor hand. Having
a tell puts you at such a disadvantage that
some elite players wear sunglasses and
hooded sweatshirts to ensure they don’t
reveal too much.
As teachers, we also have tells—unintentional
cues that reveal more than we realize about
what we’re thinking, such as whether an
answer was right or wrong or whether we
valued what a student said. A tell causes
us to communicate more than we realize,
earlier than we realize it. It compromises
our ability to withhold the answer and can
often result in our unwittingly communicating
disdain for errors.
One of my tells as a teacher was the word
“interesting,” offered in a benign but slightly

patronizing tone of voice and usually with
a “Hmmm” in front of it and a single long
blink of both eyes. I would use it, without
realizing it, in my English classes when a
student gave an interpretation I thought was
flimsy. I know this was my tell because one
day after a student offered an interpretation
of a chapter that I disagreed with, I said,
“Hmmm. Interesting.” At which point, a
student named Danielle said quite clearly
from the back of the classroom, “Uh oh. Try
again, Danny!” She knew what “interesting”
meant: “Well, that was disappointing.”
Like most teachers, I was saying a lot more
than I thought I was. My message to Danny
was, “You probably should have kept that
thought to yourself,” and Danny and all
my students knew that. So much for making
 it safe to be wrong. And of course I was
tipping savvy students off in other ways. I
could always count on Danielle to step in
just when I wanted someone to debunk a
poor idea. She was so reliable! In part, it
turns out, because she’d been interpreting
my tell all semester long and as a result
got a steady stream of hints about how to
express my own opinion back to me.
One of my most capable colleagues describes
a different tell. When students gave an
answer in her class, she would write it on
the board if it was correct, but wouldn’t
bother if it was wrong. Sometimes she would
call on a student and turn to the board,
marker poised as if to write, only to turn
back to the class upon hearing the answer,
and recap the marker. Click. Message received.
We all have tells—several, probably—and
because they are unintentional, we may
send them over and over, communicating a
message to students that undercuts what
we might intend to say. Students figure out
these tells surprisingly quickly, so it’s
important to seek them out in our own
teaching and manage them. Of course,
we’ll never be perfect. Of course, it’s fine
to say, “Interesting” or even to explicitly
say, “I think we can do better” or “No, I’m
sorry that’s not correct.” You just want to
be aware of and intentional about what
you communicate and when. Think for
a moment about what might be the most
common teacher tell: “Does anyone have a
different answer?” (When was the last time
you said that when someone got it right?) In
using this phrase without intentionality, you
would first communicate that the answer
was wrong and therefore risk disengaging
students from thinking as deeply about it
as they would if they didn’t know. Second,
you would implicitly say to the student who
answered, “If that’s all you’ve got, please
don’t speak again.”
It’s worth noting that the most persistent
tells are usually in response to wrong
answers, but we can also have tells for right
answers—a big bright face or perhaps the
inflection on the word “why” in a statement
like, “And can you tell us why you think
Wilbur is afraid?” Clearly, it’s not a negative
to show appreciation and enthusiasm for
a great answer. But it is worth considering
whether that enthusiasm sometimes gives
away too much, too soon or, if it’s used
too often, what its absence communicates.
Ideally, we’d all be alert to our tells and
manage them—replacing them as often as
possible with a consistent and balanced
expression of appreciation that’s not quite
approval.

PRAISE RISK-TAKING
The final point in creating a Culture of Error
is to praise students for taking risks and
facing down the challenge of a difficult
subject. Katie McNickle talked about this
when she reflected on how she built the
Culture of Error in her classroom: “I praise
students who are brave enough to ask
questions.” It’s especially useful to encourage
 students to take risks when they’re not
sure. A statement such as, “This is a tough
question. If you’re struggling with it, that’s a
good sign. Now, who’ll be bold and start us
off?” reminds students that being a scholar
means offering your thoughts when you’re
not sure, and sometimes because you’re not
sure. You can reinforce that positively by
saying, for example, “I love the fact that
this is a hard question and so many of you
have your hands in the air.” If discussing a
particularly difficult passage in a book, try
acknowledging the difficulty by saying
something like, “This is a question that
people have debated for decades. Who even
knows if there’s a right answer, but you’re
really attacking this.” In a Culture of Error,
students should feel good about stepping
out on a limb, whether they’re right or wrong.

 Example Phrases
• “I love the fact that this is a hard question and that
I see so many brave hands in the air. Thank you for
 taking a risk.”
• “People have debated this question for centuries. Who
even knows if there’s a right answer. What’s important
is that you’re really grappling with it.”
• “This is a tough question. If you’re struggling with it,
that’s a good sign. Now, who will be bold and start
us off?”
• “Romelle has been brave enough to offer to share
his work so that we can revise it because he made
a mistake that a lot of us made. So, give him two
claps on two. One…two!”
