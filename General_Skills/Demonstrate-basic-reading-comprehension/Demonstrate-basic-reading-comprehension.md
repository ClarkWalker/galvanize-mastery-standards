#### At a high level, what do developers mean when they say that 'you need to be a good problem solver?'
* "what they're typically talking about, is being able to turn words into working software..."
  * given a goal, it may take months or years and teams of people and the goal can be broken down into many smaller problems

#### The article mentions that problem solving is 'cyclical and fractal'. What does that mean?
* cyclical I take to mean that you keep repeating it once you go through it you start again and each time through you get better results and deeper understandings.
* fractal I take to mean that a problem can be broken down into smaller problems which may in turn be broken down to smaller problems, which may in turn be broken down to smaller problems...

#### What is a productive developer?
