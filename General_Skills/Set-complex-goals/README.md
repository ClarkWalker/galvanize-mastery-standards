Setting complex goals with the "SMART" method

I have chosen to demonstrate this standard in 2 ways 1 by setting a detailed short term goal and 2 by setting a longer term 1 month with sub goals.

I have decided to employ the smart method for todays goals.

My goal for the day is
goal for 2018-01-16_TUE
submit 4 mastery items before end of day
  √ Specific - which items?
    * command line mystery
    * set complex goals
    * Connect a backend to a database
    * Describe stacks & queues
  √ Measurable - 4 mastery items
  √ Actionable -
    * organize a clean browser window for the task, stay focused
  √ Realistic-stretch - this feels like a challenge that is doable
  √ Time-bound - end of day

I intend to do a personal retro for this goal today last thing before I leave.

longer term goal

  Specific -
  Measurable -
  Actionable -
  Realistic-stretch -
  Time-bound -


Other notes I sourced on SMART goal setting

S.M.A.R.T. Is a system for setting goals

S - specific, significant, stretching
M - measurable, meaningful, motivational
A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented
R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, results-oriented
T - time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, trackable

My edited personal version that I am choosing to employ is as follows
S - specific
M - measurable
A - actionable
R - realistic-stretch
T - time-bound

After some thinking I feel like those words balance eachother out nicely
