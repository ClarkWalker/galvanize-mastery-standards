#Demonstrate proficiency in unfamiliar, non-trivial technologies
* Add a feature in an unfamiliar environment
* fix a bug in an unfamiliar environment

In q3 I learned GO and built an api.
the feature I added was the ability to read information from the database
the bug I fixed was setting up the environment variables for remote deployment

I followed a tutorial on how to build a json api in GO although weirdly didn't show how to connect it to a database so I looked up ORM libraries for GO and came across GORM which is really well documented I followed their basic crud setup.  I was able to figure out how to connect the json API to the GORM PG database myself and consulted Berto when I got stuck, he helped me understand environment variables and their importance in GO.
