#Discover missing information from a technical source
* Given a tutorial in an unfamiliar environment, identify what knowledge is assumed and find it.

In q3 I learned GO and built an API.

I followed a tutorial on how to build a json API in GO although weirdly didn't show how to connect it to a database so I looked up ORM libraries for GO and came across GORM which is really well documented I followed their basic crud setup.  I was able to figure out how to connect the json API to the GORM PG database myself and consulted Berto when I got stuck, he helped me understand environment variables and their importance in GO.
