* Solve a logic puzzle using the Poly√° method and take a photo of the solution
* Write a paragraph about the solution and how you went about finding it.

See screenshots for the problem I solved and the solution

Here are my Polya notes
* Understand the problem
  * This is a grid logic problem, where multiple elements must be coordinated in order to solve it correctly

* Devise a plan
  * read all the available information and hints and see if there is anything that jumps out as obvious.
  * once one deduction has been made reread the information again and see if another deduction can be made from the new information that was just deduced.

* Carry out the plan
  * Done hahaha :P

* Reflect
  * I solved the problem by continuously rereading the hints.  I did solve it quite slow though perhaps the process could benefit from more deliberate study of the graphs and how they relate once a few decisions have been made.  All and all I found this method successful in that my aims were clear and I did not wonder what to do when I got confused I simply reread the questions I never really felt stuck and when something occurred to me I would go suss it out in the graph.
