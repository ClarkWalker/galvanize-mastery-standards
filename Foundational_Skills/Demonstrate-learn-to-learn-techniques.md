The value of build and burns

  I spent the last break building a project in Go over and over again.  Each time I gained a new understanding of the code that I was writing.  I started out just copying code from a tutorial I would just write it out line by line just soaking it in not thinking about it too hard although I would stop to think or research something if it really seemed foreign to me.

  The second time through I started experimenting and trying new things. A little tweak here a big change there printed everything to the console that I could think to, I'd poke and prod and break and unbreak the project.

  All and all I rebuilt the project 4 times learning more and more each time being able to do more on my own each time.  I think that the key for me was actually deleting the project and starting over it was scary but I realized that I had to be okay with starting from nothing.  The cool thing about actually burning after you build is that you get the chance to depend on yourself.  Admittedly I used git to make new branches so that all previous versions were backed up but while I was working on a new iteration I didn't allow myself to look at the previous versions.
