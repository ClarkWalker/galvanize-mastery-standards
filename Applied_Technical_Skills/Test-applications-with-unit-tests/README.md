we will be testing a function that doubles a number that it takes as an argument
function name will be double
if double receives 2 as an argument it should return 4
if double receives 16 as an argument it should return 32
if double receives something that is not a number as an argument it should return an error message
if double nothing as an argument it should return an error message
