For this standard I a am reviewing Shayla Richard's code from her Q1 project, her project repo can be found here. https://github.com/Shayla303/ShowBreakdown

Shayla is also reviewing my code from my Q1 project.  That repo can be found here. https://github.com/ClarkWalker/caesarCypher

My thoughts on Shayla's code.
* Things I liked
  * 1. I opened up app.js and the first thing that struck me was how clean the code looked.  It flows nicely, there is space between things to make it more readable and separate ideas.
  * 2. Another thing I liked is the naming conventions seem really intuitive and well thought out, I love that I want to write code like that and work with people who write clean code like that.
  * 3. document.createElement('el').  I Don't think that I have ever used that and I think it's pretty cool because it reminds me that you can dynamically update the DOM in an SPA kind of way with raw DOM manipulation.  I think that deepens my understanding of front end frameworks and such.
* Somthing I thought could be improved
  * Global variables were declared at the top of app.js, I don't think that we learned about that at that point so it's understandable.  :)


Her thoughts on my code.
I am looking at Clark’s Q1 project Caesar Cypher.
What I noticed initially was the organization of the files. Public and styling are neat and succinct.
Each app file is appropriately named, and there is quite a bit going on.
This is an encryption app so the code immediately doesn’t ring out what’s happening. However the way things are named help me follow the code.
There are notes in the app that tell you when and how the encryption is happening based on inputs. The usage of local variables make it easier to see what is happening inside each function making it easier for a partner to collaborate, update, or take over the project. I would say pseudo code in your functions so we know what is happening for a non crypto-engineer. on line on line 42 where the "cypher" code happens. Is that making a new

My reflection on her thoughts on my code and what I learned
I like her feedback on pseudo-coding my work where it might be confusing I would really like to write readable maintainable code that speaks for it self so I take that feed back to heart and I wouldn't have known that if she hadn't shared her perspective.
