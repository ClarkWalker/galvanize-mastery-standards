For this standard I a am reviewing Shayla Richard's code from her Q1 project, her project repo can be found here. https://github.com/Shayla303/ShowBreakdown

Shayla is also reviewing my code from my Q1 project.  That repo can be found here. https://github.com/ClarkWalker/caesarCypher

My thoughts on her code.
* Things I liked
  * 1. I opened up app.js and the first thing that struck me was how clean the code looked.  
  * 2. It flows nicely, there is space between things to make it more readable and separate ideas.
  * 3. Another thing I liked is the naming conventions seem really intuitive and well thought out, I love that I want to write code like that and work with people who write clean code like that.
* Somthing I thought could be improved
  * Global variables were used.
